# Dots and Boxes

dots and boxes was a project for prgramming1 course in my first term in the computer and systems engineering.

## Problem statement

- we had to implement the game of dots in boxes with all its rules in C programming language.
- a vs_computer and a 2_players modes should be coded
- two board sizes , bigenner and expert , should be coded
- there were no constraints on how to implement the vs_computer mode
- there were no constraints on how to implement the user interface
